<h1>The Definitive Guide to SOA: Oracle Service Bus 3</h1>

<p>The associated ZIP file contains the source code for the book. The root of the ZIP file contains the sbconfig.jar file, 
which you will import into your OSB10gR3 server using the System Administration section of the service bus console.</p>

<p>The OSB10gR3_book directory is a Workshop workspace. When you unzip the contents of the ZIP file, preserve the directory structure. 
When you start Workshop and it prompts you for a workspace to open, create a new workspace. Then import the projects from the alsb30_book 
directory.

ALSB appear.</p>
